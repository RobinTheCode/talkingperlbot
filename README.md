A Bot Project that talks back to you in Perl
Written by Thauma

Change the file path to your .txt files and the #roomname.

Add Trigger Words to data1 - data12.txt files.

data1, data5 and data9.txt must start with ':'
example:

:Hello
:Hi

The other files don't need :

data16 - data22.txt are respose files.

Add your responses as follows
example:

Hi there, I am a bot, welcome!
Hey you are here! Great! Have a seat!

This Bot will be updated more in coming months so keep your eyes peeled and feel free to add to it.
